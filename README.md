# Time-Series-Analysis-Forecasting-of-Bituminous-Coal-Data

Academic Project - Using the bituminous coal data to find the appropriate ARIMA model and forecast using the model

Data: The data is monthly bituminous coal production in the US from January 1952 through December 1959, a total of 96 observations.

Goal: To successfully model the time series using ARMA modeling procedure.

Language: R

Approach: First we guess the model by seeing ACF & PACF, then run a series of Model Diagonistic test to see indeed if the fitted model is adequate and then we use fitted model to forecast the data

Assumption: Data is assummed to be stationary. Therfore no stationary tests are performed

Acknowledgment: This analysis was done as a part of BANA 7050 course instructed by Dr.Yichen Qin at the University of Cincinnati.
